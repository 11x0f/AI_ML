HYPOTHESIS: y = mx + c
              
                  y <-- expected result
                  x <-- given input
                  
At the time of training

    known parameters are: " y " and " x "
    
    unknown parameters are : " m " and " c "
                            
                                m <-- slope / gradient
                                c <-- y=intercept
                                
TARGET: To have best fit line.
                    
                    Best fit line will predict the output with least error
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
STEPS INVOLVED 
    1. FORWARD PROPOGATION
    2. COST FUNCTION
    3. GRADIENT DESCENT
