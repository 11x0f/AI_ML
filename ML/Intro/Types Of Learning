A machine is said to be learning from past experience(data fed in) with respect to some class of tasks, if its performance in a given task impoves with experience.

LABELLED DATASET: is one which have both input and output parameters.


1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
    Model is trained of a labelled dataset
    Based on type of output parameters supervised learning is divided into two:
    
        a. Classification (defined labels): Discrete data ( 0 or 1)

        b. Regression (no labels defined): Continious parameter in the given range
        
        
        
2. UN-SUPERVISED LEARNING
    In this learning we dont give target to our model while training.
    Training model is given only input parameters.
    Model byitself has to find a way to learn
    Two types:
    
        a. Clustering: applied to group data based on different property which the machine model finds.
        
        b. Assosication: algorithms tries to find useful relations between parameters 
        
        
3. SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING
    Dataset will be little bit labelled and largely un-labelled data.
    Hence we use un-supervised learning to find labels then feed those to supervised learning 
    Mostly applicable to image dataset were usually all datasets are not labelled.
    
    
4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
    Model keeps on increasing its performance using reward-feedback to learn the behaviour or pattern
    Agents observe input
    Agents perform action by some decision
    After its performance, agent receives reward and accordingly reinforce and the model stores in state action-action pair of information.
