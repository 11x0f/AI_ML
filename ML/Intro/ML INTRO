MACHINE LEARNING : 
    Ability of Algorithm to learn from data.
    Unlike conventional programming logic will not be provided.
    We provide input images and output "Labels", then allow the machine to comeup with proper logic.
    
    
DATA AND TERMINOLOGY:

    x_train
    y_train
    
    x_test
    y_test

    DATA ==> (applied for a purpose) ==> INFORMATION ==> ( build and process) ==> KNOWLEDGE
    
TYPES OF DATA:
    1. Nominal Data(CategoricaL) : labeled data with no ordering(no priority).
     
    2. Ordinal Data : labelled data with ordering but no relative interval difference between those data. 
     
    3. Interval Data :

    4. Binomial/binary data
    
    5. Time
    
    6.
